                <br><hr><br>
            <p> After a month of intense procrastination and artistic challenges, it feels great to say to myself, “Finally, it’s over”. As much as I love learning new aspects and methods of coding, the relief of finally completing an assignment is much more satisfactory. This was my first time building a website on my own from complete scratch and it was an amazing experience. I messed around with different elements, tags and syntaxes and learned so much about web development. There were few slip-ups here and there, but it was liberating to figure out the solutions on my own with the help of the greatest invention of mankind, YouTube. Let’s take a look at my progress from the very beginning to the very end.

                    <h2> UI/UX Design</h2> <hr>
                    <p>The first thing that I did before even creating an HTML file was wireframing. I made a rough layout in my notebook with a pencil and tried to recreate is digitally but I was not satisfied with how it looked on my screen so I went along with my notebook version of the wireframe. When I actually started coding the layout, it looked tacky and some parts required JavaScript as well. So, instead, I went along with spontaneous ideas that popped into my head, which turned out to be a lot harder than I thought because I am a very indecisive person and I kept on changing the layout time and again.<br><br>

                    <h2>Theme Choice</h2> <hr>
                    <p>The main colors that I used for my website were Black and Green. I tried to go for a command prompt-esque look and used the font “Cascadia Code” in the beginning. However, “Genos” seemed like a better fit, so it made it to the final design. There are some hints of red, green, yellow and blue in other pages, especially in the “Portfolio Page” where I used Hogwarts houses as placeholder images. The font and border colors were inspired by the colors of the four Hogwarts houses. I love Harry Potter so it had to be a part of my website. Initially, I was leaning towards a pastel theme with lilac, baby blue and pink colors.<br>
                        The inspiration behind this theme was the portfolio of <a href="https://brittanychiang.com/" target="_blank">Brittany Chiang</a>. I came across her portfolio page as I was browsing through some websites, looking for an inspiration. I was awe-struck by the minimal yet intriguing design of the website. Even though our websites don’t resemble each other at all, I was really inspired and impressed by her work.

                    <h2> Biggest Challenges</h2><hr>
                    <p> The biggest obstacle that I had to overcome while designing this website, aside from constant battles with procrastination, was not being allowed to use absolute positioning and script. Every YouTube video that I watched and, every blog that I read always mentioned either of those two things and it was tough to completely avoid using both.
                        Adding the Hamburger Menu and icons were a pain as well. I avoided using the hamburger icon from “Font Awesome” since I wasn’t sure if that was allowed and used the menu bar from “Google Fonts” instead. Also, I used photo instead of font icons to represent social media sites icon.<br>
                        Furthermore, I struggled with "perferctionism" and doubts regarding the UI design of the website. As a non-artistic yet critical person, it was challenging for me to come up with creative ideas and even more challenging to actually like them.

                    <h2>Discoveries</h2><hr>
                    <p>The best part of this entire project was discovering resourceful websites and even some stunning ones. I discovered Figma for prototyping, Awwwards for inspiration, CodingNepal for source codes and ideas and many more. I also came across many creative websites and my favorite one so far is <a href="https://onyedika.xyz/" target="_blank">Onyedika.xyz</a>. <br>
                        Aside from personal growth, I also got to know my classmates a lot better while helping each other out and complaining about the Hamburger Menu together. Watching people struggle over the same things as me put me at ease and gave me a sense of solidarity.<br>
                        Oh, and the biggest lesson that I learned throughout this project was:
                        <span>If a code somehow works, do not touch it.</span>
                        </p>

                    <h2>Git</h2><hr>
                    <p> Git and GitHub were a foreign concept to me. I had only heard about them but never had to actually use it. I was a bit lost and confused the first time and uploaded my files via drag and drop as I was not aware of the complications it could possibly cause. I abandoned that repository and created a new one entitled "Portfolio" and learned how to commit through GitBash. However, I wasn't well aware about the frequency of commits, so I only committed my code when there was a huge change. So, I only had about 3 - 4 commits in about 3 weeks. I started committing more frequently after I realised the amount of commits that I had wasn't even close to enough.

                <p>I was quite suprised to see that my all of my webpages had low to none errors. The only prominent error that was present in every webpage was a stranded closing div tag that I had forgotten to erase after deleting a div.
